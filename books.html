  <h2>Books</h2>

  <p>
    A list of books that I've read since I started this page on April 28, 2024.
  </p>

  <ul>
    <li>
      <i>The Making of the Atomic Bomb</i>, Richard Rhodes. 10/10. Insane book.
      A must read for anyone interested in the history of science or WWII. Lucky
      for me, I'm interested in both. Reading about the firebombing of Tokyo
      made me <em>really</em> sad.
    </li>
  </ul>
