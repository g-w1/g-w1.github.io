        <h3>Rust</h3>
        <ul>
        <li>
          <b>Ez, a programming language</b>
          <p>
            <a href="https://github.com/g-w1/ezc">ezc</a><br>
             Ezc is the compiler for the ez programming language that I made. It took me a while, but I learned a lot!
          </p>
        </li>
        <li>
          <b>PDFCR, a pdf code renderer</b>
          <p>
            <a href="https://github.com/g-w1/pdfcr">PDFCR</a><br>
            This is a utility to take a files and turn it into a pdf optimised for reading on a kindle (or anywhere) with bookmarks.
            I had tried render50, a tool made for the cs50 class at Harvard to render code into a pdf, but it was too
            slow for my needs because it took code, turned it into html + css, then rendered that into a pdf.
            This just takes code and makes it a pdf very fast.

          <b>Work: A Todo Manager In Rust</b>
          <p>
            <a href="https://github.com/g-w1/work">Work</a><br>
            I wanted a powerful but minimal TODO manager for the terminal.This
            is my first package in any package repository (crates.io). It was
            really fun to write. It has fuzzy finding, config management, uses a
            sqlite database, and command line arg parsing.

        <li>
          <b>Platformer In Rust</b>
          <p>
            <a href="https://github.com/g-w1/rust_game">rust_game</a><br>
            (a platformer I made in rust to learn how libraries work in rust and
            because making platformers is fun)
          </p>
        </li>
        </ul>
        <h3>Python</h3>
        <ul>
            <li>
          <b>Platformer In Python</b>
          <p>
            <a href="https://github.com/g-w1/JacobsGameForTech" >JacobsGameForTech</a ><br>
            I didn't want to use scratch for a project in school so I said how
            hard could python be. It ended up taking me 30 hrs but I learned
            python.

                <b>Passcr, a password generator</b>

                        <a href="https://github.com/g-w1/passcr">passcr</a ><br>
                        A password generator I made for a friend who was in need of passwords.
                        It uses a special format string to describe the format of the needed password
                        and then generates one based on that.

            The rest of my learning has been at home and just learning about
