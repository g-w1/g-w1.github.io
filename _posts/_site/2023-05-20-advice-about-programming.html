<p><em>[Epistimic Status: Not that confident. I’ll footnote stuff I’m even less confident on or more confident on. I’m only writing this ~3.5 years after starting to program seriously. Also, everyone learns at a different rate.

<p>A few people have approached me to ask how to learn to program computers, so I thought I would write something that could help the most people – a blog post.</p>

<p>I’ll start with the journey that I took, and then give some distilled advice.</p>

<h2 id="my-journey">My Journey</h2>

<p>By the time I started coding seriously eighth grade, I had always been familiar with code. I had done some coding camps where I copied boilerplate Java and Swift code and then changed it a bit. I knew what an if statement was, what a loop was, etc… But I never coded much at home. When I tried, I would get stuck on something and then give up on coding. I’ll assume you’re starting close to here. If you are more advanced than me – awesome!</p>

<p>In eigth grade, we had tech class, where the project was to create a game in Scratch. Scratch is a really good program, and if you are using it, that’s great! However, I tried to code my game in Scratch, but got really frustrated. I thought that if I used something else to code it, it would be easier. Starting a pattern where I say “how hard could it be,” (and then it turns out to be hard) I started using my Mom’s old Thinkpad x220 to code in <a href="https://www.pygame.org/news">pygame</a>. This undoubtedly took much more time than just doing the equivalent in scratch, but I learned python, so that’s a plus. (If you want to see the (really bad) code, <a href="https://github.com/g-w1/JacobsGameForTech/blob/master/jacobs_game_source.py">here</a> it is.)</p>

<p>I also was simultaneously learning calculus just for fun<sup id="fnref:3" role="doc-noteref"><a href="#fn:3" class="footnote" rel="footnote">1</a></sup>. I have some really cringey memories of doing Khan Academy during art class free draw. Thankfully, my art teacher was chill and didn’t mind. This allowed me to kind of understand</p>

      <p>If you want to learn calculus, which I <em>highly reccomend</em> (high school calculus becomes really easy, you can learn neural networks, and its really fun), first use 3Blue1Brown’s <em>excelent</em> <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WUvTyaaNkzM&amp;list=PL0-GT3co4r2wlh6UHTUeQsrf3mlS2lk6x">calculus playlist</a> and then do Khan Academy for practice. As long as you are motivated, I’d say only algebra is the prerequisite. <a href="https://sive.rs/kimo">There is no speed limit</a>. <a href="#fnref:3" class="reversefootnote" role="doc-backlink">&#8617;</a></p>
