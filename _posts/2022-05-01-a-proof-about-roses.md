A proof about roses? Who would have thought!

In this case, a rose is a shape generated in a polar graph from the equation

$$ r = A\cos(n \theta + \phi) $$

graphed in the domain $$ [0, 2\pi] $$.

However, something peculiar happens when you change the coefficient to $$ \theta $$ ($$ n $$).

When $$ n $$ is even, $$ 2n $$ petals are produced. On the other hand, when it is odd, $$ n $$ petals are produced (after $$ \pi $$, the petals go back over on themselves)!

My teacher said that there were proofs, but they involved calculus, so naturally I took it upon myself as a challenge to prove it without calculus!

The Proof Follows:

Assume for the proof that $$ n \in \text{the set of all odd numbers} $$.

> At $$ \pi $$, $$ \cos(n\theta) $$ will always be $$ -1 $$, while $$ \cos(2n\theta) $$ will always be 1.

Proving the above statement will allow us to conclude the proof.

Recall the function for period of a sinusoidal: the period of a function of the form $$ \cos(mx) $$ is $$ \text{period} = \frac{2\pi}{m} $$. Rearranging this with some algebra, we get $$ m = \frac{2\pi}{\text{period}} $$. At $$ 2\pi $$, $$ m $$ periods will have been completed, so it follows that at $$ \pi $$, $$ m/2 $$ periods will have been completed. If $$ m $$ is an odd number, as it is in our case, then the amount of periods completed at $$ \pi $$ will have a fractional component of $$ 1/2 $$. When the amount of periods completed has a fractional component of $$ 1/2 $$, in a regular cosine curve, it means that the function output must be $$ -1 $$ because that is the value of cosine at half a cycle.

Conversely, we can prove that where the coefficient is even, in the case of $$ \cos(2n\theta) $$, the output at $$ \pi $$ *must* be $$ 1 $$ with the same logic. At $$ \pi $$, $$ 2n/2 = n $$ periods have been completed, which means that the value must be the same as the start of a cycle in a cose graph which is $$ 1 $$.

Okay, we have now established this, but how does it help us? Recall that in a polar graph, negating the radius is the same as adding $$ \pi $$ to $$ \theta $$. Adding $$ \pi $$ to a cosine graph will shift it left by $$ \pi $$. So for any polar graph, taking the graph from $$ [\pi, 2\pi] $$, multiplying it by -1, and translating it to the domain $$ [0, \pi] $$ will produce the **exact same graph**. Since a graph in the second half of a period, when we multiply $$ \theta $$ by an odd number, from $$ [\pi, 2\pi] $$, is $$ -1 $$ times the graph in the first half of the period (because the periods are exactly $$ 1/2 $$ period out of sync), **when you shift left and multiply the graph by $$ -1 $$, it overlaps perfectly with the graph from $$ [0, \pi] $$**! This causes there to be no new petals drawn.

And since multiplying $$ \theta $$ by an even coefficient leaves it at the start of a cycle at $$ \pi $$, it **does not overlap on itself when multiplied by $$ -1 $$ and shifted by $$ \pi $$ to the left**. This causes new petals to be drawn where they don't overlap.
