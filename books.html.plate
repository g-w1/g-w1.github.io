    A list of books that I've read since I started this page on April 28, 2024.
  </p>

  <ul>
    <li id="tmotab">
      <i>The Making of the Atomic Bomb</i>, Richard Rhodes. Finished on
      4/27/2024. 10/10. Insane book. A must read for anyone interested in the
      history of science or WWII. Lucky for me, I'm interested in both. Reading
      about the firebombing of Tokyo made me <em>really</em> sad.

        <i>Permutation City</i>, Greg Egan. Finished on 5/10/2024. 9/10. The
        beginning of the book felt so real that I didn't need to suspend
        <em>any</em> disbelief. All of the events felt so plausible that I felt
        they could have happened in real life. The theory of consciousness and
        world-formation is very similar to my best guess of what is actually
        true so the book felt like it was just speculative fiction that could
        actually happen.
        <span class="s"
          >Then towards the end, things started happening that I didn't think
          would actually happen in real life. Like the computers stopping
          working, world falling apart, etc. I guess this book's fatal flaw is
          that it was too realistic. For most science fiction, I just suspend
          disbelief. But Egan's writing and ideas were so good that I could
          actually think critically about the science and philosophy. When
          things started to not be realistic towards the end, I got
          disengaged.</span
        >
        But this book is still better than most sci-fi because it was
        <em>so realistic for so long</em>.
      </p>
      <p>
        I really loved the premise and it has basically stopped me from writing
        about this general topic of consciousness and computation because I feel
        that Egan has explored it thoroughly enough that I don't have much to
        add. I finally feel free to ignore the blog post on this topic that's
        been sitting in my drafts for almost a year. My main remaining question
        is: Why do you need computers to start simulations? If they are just
        math, shouldn't the math exist independently of any physical reality?
        What does adding a physically realized Turing Machine thing to the
        system do? My best guess is that all mathematically possible universes
        exist and that we are just living in one of them (this is Tegmark's
        <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mathematical_universe_hypothesis"
          >Mathematical universe hypothesis</a
        >). I'm still quite unsure though.

        <i>Speaker for the Dead</i>, Orson Scott Card. Finished on 5/13/2024.
        10/10. This book was so good I messed up my sleep schedule for it and
        read it in two days. I don't even regret it. I had originally read this
        book 4 years ago it is every bit as good as I remember it to be (I
        didn't remember anything about the plot, only that it was insanely
        good). It doesn't have the thrill of <i>Ender's Game</i>, and is nowhere
        near as epic, but it makes up for that with emotional depth and plot.
        There were a few points where I felt that the characters should have
        made better decisions, but looking back on it, I think those points made
        Ender even more powerful.
        <span class="s"
          >Why doesn't Novinha look into what was in her files to understand
          what made Pipo and Libo die? She's a scientist. Once Ender understood
          the Piggies and told them that humans don't have a third life, all the
          problems were solved. This struck me as "irrational" and "weird." But
          maybe Card included this part to show just how "stuck" Novinha was and
          to accentuate the "savior" complex of Ender.
        </span>

        Some parts hit me really hard, especially towards the end, and there was
        definitely a strong religious undertone. This was the first Card book I
        read after reading
        <a href="https://daystareld.com/orson-scott-card/"
          >Daystar Eld's analysis of his views towards gay people </a
        >. I knew that he was Christian.
        <span class="s"
          >And Christianity (Catholocism) does play a big part in the book. But
          I was surprised (and delighted) with how self-aware he was about it.
          Ender is an agnostic, although he seems to be on the path towards
          conversion the whole book, and I could appreciate how Card
          <em>invented his own religion</em> of speaking.
        </span>
        Either Card is much less one-sided than I previously thought or he is
        really good at compartmentalizing. I hope it's the former.
