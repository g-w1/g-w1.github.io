    A list of books that I've read since I started this page on April 28, 2024. Epistemic Status: I don't spend very much time on actually writing the reviews. I'm mainly keeping this page up to have a list of books that I've read with my high level thoughts on each.

  <ul>
    <li id="tmotab">
      <i>The Making of the Atomic Bomb</i>, Richard Rhodes. Finished on
      4/27/2024. 10/10. Insane book. A must read for anyone interested in the
      history of science or WWII. Lucky for me, I'm interested in both. Reading
      about the firebombing of Tokyo made me <em>really</em> sad.

        <i>Permutation City</i>, Greg Egan. Finished on 5/10/2024. 9/10. The
        beginning of the book felt so real that I didn't need to suspend
        <em>any</em> disbelief. All of the events felt so plausible that I felt
        they could have happened in real life. The theory of consciousness and
        world-formation is very similar to my best guess of what is actually
        true so the book felt like it was just speculative fiction that could
        actually happen.
        <span class="s"
          >Then towards the end, things started happening that I didn't think
          would actually happen in real life. Like the computers stopping
          working, world falling apart, etc. I guess this book's fatal flaw is
          that it was too realistic. For most science fiction, I just suspend
          disbelief. But Egan's writing and ideas were so good that I could
          actually think critically about the science and philosophy. When
          things started to not be realistic towards the end, I got
          disengaged.</span
        >
        But this book is still better than most sci-fi because it was
        <em>so realistic for so long</em>.
      </p>
      <p>
        I really loved the premise and it has basically stopped me from writing
        about this general topic of consciousness and computation because I feel
        that Egan has explored it thoroughly enough that I don't have much to
        add. I finally feel free to ignore the blog post on this topic that's
        been sitting in my drafts for almost a year. My main remaining question
        is: Why do you need computers to start simulations? If they are just
        math, shouldn't the math exist independently of any physical reality?
        What does adding a physically realized Turing Machine thing to the
        system do? My best guess is that all mathematically possible universes
        exist and that we are just living in one of them (this is Tegmark's
        <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mathematical_universe_hypothesis"
          >Mathematical universe hypothesis</a
        >). I'm still quite unsure though.

        <i>Speaker for the Dead</i>, Orson Scott Card. Finished on 5/13/2024.
        10/10. This book was so good I messed up my sleep schedule for it and
        read it in two days. I don't even regret it. I had originally read this
        book 4 years ago it is every bit as good as I remember it to be (I
        didn't remember anything about the plot, only that it was insanely
        good). It doesn't have the thrill of <i>Ender's Game</i>, and is nowhere
        near as epic, but it makes up for that with emotional depth and plot.
        There were a few points where I felt that the characters should have
        made better decisions, but looking back on it, I think those points made
        Ender even more powerful.
        <span class="s"
          >Why doesn't Novinha look into what was in her files to understand
          what made Pipo and Libo die? She's a scientist. Once Ender understood
          the Piggies and told them that humans don't have a third life, all the
          problems were solved. This struck me as "irrational" and "weird." But
          maybe Card included this part to show just how "stuck" Novinha was and
          to accentuate the "savior" complex of Ender.
        </span>
      </p>
      <p>
        Some parts hit me really hard, especially towards the end, and there was
        definitely a strong religious undertone. This was the first Card book I
        read after reading
        <a href="https://daystareld.com/orson-scott-card/"
          >Daystar Eld's analysis of his views towards gay people </a
        >. I knew that he was Christian.
        <span class="s"
          >And Christianity (Catholicism) does play a big part in the book. But
          I was surprised (and delighted) with how self-aware he was about it.
          Ender is an agnostic, although he seems to be on the path towards
          conversion the whole book, and I could appreciate how Card
          <em>invented his own religion</em> of speaking.
        </span>
        Either Card is much less one-sided than I previously thought or he is
        really good at compartmentalizing. I hope it's the former.

        <i>Naive Set Theory</i>, Paul R. Halmos. Finished on 6/5/24. 7/10. This
        was a fun book to read. This is also probably the slowest book that I
        have read cover-to-cover. I'd estimate I took on average twenty minutes
        per page. I can't know for sure since I only started time-tracking after
        starting this book. It also was my first pure math textbook that I
        finished cover to cover. I did all of the exercises and for around the
        first half of the book, whenever the author started to prove a theorem,
        I would look away, write a proof, and then compare my proof with the one
        in the book. In the latter half of the book, the proofs both got harder
        and I was getting impatient so I stopped doing this. Sometimes my proof
        and the one from the book were the same, but oftentimes they were
        totally different. In general, I felt like my proofs were sometimes
        lacking rigor. I didn't sweat it too much since this was my first pure
        math book and I figured I'd have lots of time to learn how to write
        airtight, rigorous proofs later (and I was mainly aiming to learn set
        theory concepts).
      </p>
      <p>
        ChatGPT was extremely helpful in explaining concepts to me and checking
        if some of my arguments were valid. I would often ask it something like
        "give a concrete example of a partially ordered set" and it would
        gracefully reply with a few examples that I could use to build my
        intuition.
      </p>
      <p>
        I'd say the main drawback of the book was it's age. Some of the
        terminology used is standard today (for example
        <em>one-to-one</em> instead of <em>injective</em> and
        <em>onto</em> instead of <em>surjective</em>) which made it a little
        harder to look stuff that I was confused about up, but otherwise it was
        fine. Also, a few parts of the book were probably more confusing than
        they needed to be. For example, transfinite induction and recursion were
        quite confusing to me. Then I looked them up on YouTube, watched a
        lecture by a UC Berkeley professor, and got much less confused. I think
        this is a general lesson that I can apply: if I'm finding a concept
        confusing, I should just look up a different formulation of it instead
        of struggling from the book. I've heard/read others say this and I think
        I internalized it towards the end of this book.
      </p>
      <p>
        Overall I'm glad that I read this book, but now I'm ready to move into
        more useful branches of math like Linear Algebra with more modern
        textbooks.

      <i>Energy: A Human History</i>, Richard Rhodes. Finished on 6/14/24. 7/10. <i>Energy</i> was an interesting read, but didn't teach me that much new. Rhodes starts with the development of coal in England and then uses that to motivate the developement of engines and eventually all modern technology. A lot of names were thrown around; each chapter focused on a different technology, but I never felt that I was really able to understand a specific person because we had to move on to the next technology so fast. This wasn't ideal. It was interesting and I'm glad I read it; it gives me a good starting point for understanding how the industrial revolution really took off. I didn't read that closely, so I may want to read certain sections again if/when I forget certain parts. Overall, it was a good read, but nothing outstanding here.

        <i>The Man from the Future: The Visionary Life of John von Neumann</i>, Ananyo Bhattacharya. Finished on 7/18/24. 8/10.
      </p>
      <p>
        A pretty good book. I learned a lot about Von Neumann. He was a pretty smart guy. He just loved to think. I wish we had more people like him around today. Or maybe we do, but we just don't know who they are.
        Maybe they're working in the big AI labs or on Wall Street instead of for the military. It's hard to tell.
      </p>
      <p>
        It's pretty sad how young he died so young at 53 without getting to see the applications of his work on computers take hold. I also feel the same way about Turing.
      </p>
      <p>
        Overall, the book itself was pretty good with each chapter focusing on an element of his life. It was well-written and engaging. And the explanations of the science seemed spot-on which was super nice.
        I've realized that I like biographies a lot, so I want to read about Lyndon B. Johnson next.

        <i>Sophie's World</i>, Jostein Gaarder. Finished on 11/21/24. 9/10
      </p>

      <p>This book was a delight to read in both content and format. It reminded me of <a href="https://michaelnotebook.com/df/index.html">discovery fiction</a>, although it's a bit different because Sophie does get lectured on philosophy instead of discovering it herself. Yet the lectures always felt very exciting to me. I got the book last spring for my birthday and read it on and off for a period of about six months (I was really busy over the summer and then I accidentally left it at home when I went to college).</p>
      <p>The book reminded me a lot of <i>Gödel Escher Bach</i>: there were explanations interspersed with story, and there was always at least one level of meta going (sometimes more!). I really enjoyed thinking about free will in relation to one of the meta levels (<span class="s">the one where the major writes Sophie and Alberto pondering their own free will</span>). I think more exploration into the meta would have been cool, but I can understand why Gaarder chose not to. In general, I really enjoyed how most of the concepts explicitly mentioned were also allegorically <em>shown</em> through the story.</p>
      <p>I kind of wish I had put some of the objective facts into Anki so that I would remember them, but it would have also made the book less enjoyable to read. I think I now have enough of an overview of different types of philosophy that I can read more about them if I want to.</p>

    <p>Ending spoilers: <span class="s">
      I felt that the ending was a bit weird. After it was revealed that the major was writing the story, thinking about it through that lens was quite fun. But then towards the end of the story the lens flipped and Sophie and Alberto were outside of the book inside the book. One hypothesis I have is that Gaarder was trying to illustrate that both stories really happened in <em>his</em> mind, but this is a bit confusing to reason about since I thought the 'outer' story was taking place in a physicalist world, not a magic one. Maybe Gaarder made it ambigious to make the reader think.

        <i>Special Topics in Calamity Physics</i>, Marisha Pessl. Finished on 12/11/24. 8/10.</p>
      <p>
        The book started slow but then gradually picked up pace and felt like a thriller towards the end. It's both a coming of age novel and a mystery novel, and the ending made me think more than most endings. The character development throughout the whole book was exquisite; every time I felt like I knew a character, a new detail would come up that would throw me off guard. I was constantly getting surprised by new details, which don't only develop the characters but also provide evidence for the mystery.
      </p>
      <p>
        I do want to do a more thorough re-read at one point, since (spoilers for ending) <span class="s">the answer to the mystery is not actually revealed at the end. I have some guesses about what happened, but they are only guesses. I think doing a second pass with all the context of the ending would be enough to solve it, since I would be looking at every detail and questioning it.</span> It reminds me a lot of other rational fiction that I've read like HPMOR that foreshadow key details from the very beginning (thinking back on how the book starts, I am having lots of 'a-ha' moments and places where I should have noticed confusion). Given how much I resonate with this type of fiction, it's funny that I got this book from my high school's English Department as a graduation gift. After I finished the book, I sent a thank you email to my english teacher, since I really liked it (and messed up my sleep schedule for a day over it).

        <i>Great Mambo Chicken and the Transhuman Condition</i>, Ed Regis. Finished on 12/26/24. 8/10
      </p>
      <p>
        This book was quite entertaining to read and I appreciated how it gave a sort of intellectual heritage for some of the circles that I find myself in. As I was reading the book, I started to become disillusioned with transhumanism, or at least the version the book presented — it seemed like a bunch of the characters were kind of out of their minds and way too idealistic. I don't think that nanotechnology will solve literally all problems that are in the laws of physics, but some people in the book sure seemed to think so. However, when criticizing a movement like this, it's important to make sure that you're criticizing the strongest argument in favor of it (to be charitable), yet I don't think this book is that strong of an argument in favor of transhumanism (I've felt much more moved by various blog posts). Maybe it isn't trying to be, and that's okay. It was quite entertaining, and the history was illuminating.

        <i>UNSONG</i>, Scott Alexander. Finished on 3/1/25. 9/10
      </p>
      <p>
        This is just an extremely good book all around. It sometimes resonated personally, sometimes made me laugh out loud, and sometimes made me feel quite emotional. Around two years ago, I read the original serial version on my Kindle. This time, I read the print version, which has been slightly edited. It was just as good as the original and I really value having a print copy. I don't think this book is my all-time favorite, but it's up there with books like <i>Ender's Game</i>.
