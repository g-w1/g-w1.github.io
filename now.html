  <h2>Now</h2>
  I'm at Brown University. I'm taking some proof based math classes which are pretty cool. I'm also working part time doing research in <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.04332">Gradient Routing</a> (a new method to localize computation in neural networks) under the mentorship of Alex Turner.

  I'll update this again soon. Last updated: Oct 14, 2024.
