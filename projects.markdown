## Ez, a programming language
[ezc](https://github.com/g-w1/ezc)

Ezc is the compiler for the ez programming language that I made. It took me a while, but I learned a lot!

## Pdfcr, a pdf code renderer
[pdfcr](https://github.com/g-w1/pdfcr)

This is a utility to take a files and turn it into a pdf optimised for reading on a kindle (or anywhere) with bookmarks. I had tried render50, a tool made for the cs50 class at Harvard to render code into a pdf, but it was too slow for my needs because it took code, turned it into html + css, then rendered that into a pdf. This just takes code and makes it a pdf very fast.

## Work: A Todo Manager In Rust
[work](https://github.com/g-w1/work)

I wanted a powerful but minimal TODO manager for the terminal.This is my first package in any package repository (crates.io). It was really fun to write. It has fuzzy finding, config management, uses a sqlite database, and command line arg parsing.

## Platformer In Rust
[rust_game](https://github.com/g-w1/rust_game)

(a platformer I made in rust to learn how libraries work in rust and because making platformers is fun)

## Platformer In Python
[jacobsGameForTech](https://github.com/g-w1/jacobsgamefortech)

I didn't want to use scratch for a project in school so I said how hard could python be. It ended up taking me 30 hrs but I learned python.

## Ultimate Tic Tac Toe

Multidimensional Tic-Tac-Toe!

## Passcr, a password generator
[passcr](https://github.com/g-w1/passcr)

A password generator I made for a friend who was in need of passwords. It uses a special format string to describe the format of the needed password and then generates one based on that.

# Learning

## [Recurse Center](https://recurse.com/)
The Recurse Center is a “self-directed, community-driven educational retreat for programmers based in New York City.”

I was in the m2’20 batch there. I did a one week session in February 2020.

## Self Directed
The rest of my learning has been at home and just learning about whatever interested me or working on projects.
