  <h2>Now</h2>
  I'm studying math (working through <i>Naive Set Theory</i>), making some tools for thought, coding, and meditating. School just ended so I have a LOT of free time. I'm trying to maximize how much deep work I'm doing and I want to become really comfortable with proofs. If you want to talk, please reach out!
